PirepList_v1.0
==============

This module is for those who have multiple airlines. 
What it does? It lists PIREPS based on the chosen airline rather than listing the long list of all pireps.

Install:

1. Unzip in the order of folders(If you have different skin, copy . tpl files into skin folder).
2. Access by <?php echo url('/airline') ;?>.
3. Enjoy
